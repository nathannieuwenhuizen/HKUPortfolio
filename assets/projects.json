For each puzzle you get some extra time, but the level increases during the course of the game. Try to get the highest possible score and beat your own high score! Special mechanic!The interesting thing about this game is the fact that you get a time pressure when solving these sliding puzzles. This ensures that the game first starts with easy puzzles to solve so that the player does not get overwhelmed. Solving this combination of time pressure and a soothing sliding puzzle creates an interesting twist!",
