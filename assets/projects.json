Research from mapping tree density at a global scale shows that there are around 3.04 trillion trees on our planet that hold around 400 Gigaton worth of CO2 (Crowther, 2015). Further studies estimate that there is room for another 1.2 trillion trees on our planets which would undo around 10 years worth of global anthropogenic emissions.\n<br>\nBut how do you get humanity to plant 1 trillion trees?\nBy abusing the system and making tree growth have economic benefits. \n<br>\nA project by: Marnix Licht, Annalie Bruns, Rolando Ritzen en Nathan Nieuwenhuizen\n\n",
